\title{Convolutional Neural Networks for Identify Target Entity Types}


\begin{abstract}
Identifying the target type of entity bearing queries can help improve the overall performance of the search. In this work, we propose a deep neural network approach to solve the problem. The main benefit of this approach is that it is not necessary to provide hand-made features to the network. The main contribution of this paper is to use CNN networks, to extract different aspect of importance in target type identification problem. We show our approach outperforms the existing LTR approach by a remarkable margin.
