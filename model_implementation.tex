\section{Model Implementation Details}
This section describes the configuration of the FF and CNN+FF Models.

\textbf{Model Training} is performed using 5 fold \textit{nested cross-validation} \cite{cawley2010over} where model hyperparameters are selected for each test fold based on standard CV experiments on the training folds.

\textbf{Model Optimization} use the Adam optimizer with batch size 128, learning rate 0.0001. We implemented our model using Keras \cite{chollet2015keras}.

\textbf{Model Structure} model structure of CNN+FF is depicted in fig.\ref{proposeModel} The feedforward model of type centric approach is a three-layer network with [1000, 1000, 5000] neurons. The activation function is relu. the dropout parameter is selected to be 0.3. The feedforward model of entity centric approach is a one-layer network with 1000 neurons. The activation function is Relu. the dropout parameter is selected to be 0.
