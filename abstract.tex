Detecting entity types that are targeted by the queries help to understand the underlying intent of the queries and also improve the entity retrieval performance. In this paper, we address the task of automatically identifying target types of entity bearing queries.  We propose a convolutional neural network approach that can learn important features, without further need to design hand-crafted features required in the learning to rank approaches. Using a standard test collection, we show that our model significantly and substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art probabilistic models  and is on par with the learning to rank approach with respect to NDCG@1. 
%the target type of entity bearing queries is shown to improve the overall performance of entity search. These target types are In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network approach to address the target type identification task. Using this approach, we The main benefit of this approach is that it is not necessary to provide hand-made features to the network. The main contribution of this paper is to use CNN networks, to extract different aspect of importance in target type identification problem. We show our approach outperforms the existing LTR approach by a remarkable margin.
